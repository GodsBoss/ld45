            To mine rocks, you need pickaxes (see below).

    <h3>Pickaxe tiers</h3>
    <p>There are three tiers of pickaxes, every tier can mine everything the previous tier can mine and more:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The wooden pickaxe is entirely made of wood. It can mine normal rocks, but nothing else.</li>
      <li>After mining some rocks, you can craft the stone pickaxe. With it, you can mine iron ore and coal.</li>
      <li>Smelting iron ore in a furnace gives you iron, which can be crafted into an iron pickaxe. This is the best pickaxe, which can mine gold ore and diamonds.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Winning</h3>
    <p>You must craft the crown of epic nerdiness to win. Rumors say you need a few (3) diamonds and some (8) gold ingots.</p>
    <h3>Losing</h3>
    <p>Enemies were planned, but didn't make it into the game. You can die of hunger, but only very slooooowly.</p>
